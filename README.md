# MP3 Compression as a Means to Improve Robustness against Adversarial Noise Targeting Attention-based End-to-End Speech Recognition

Abstract

Adversarial Examples represent an imminent security threat to any Machine Learning system. The present thesis addresses this issue by proposing MP3-compression as a potential measure to reduce the susceptibility of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to be mislead by Audio Adversarial Examples (AAEs). In essence, we used the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate untargeted AAEs in the form of adversarial noise added to original speech samples. We used a feature inversion procedure to convert the adversarial examples from the feature into the audio domain. Different from prior work, we targeted an end-to-end, fully neural ASR system (namely ESPnet) featuring a hybrid decoder enhanced with both Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Attention mechanisms. We found that MP3 compression applied to adversarial examples indeed reduces the recognition errors when compared to raw, uncompressed adversarial inputs. This result was validated by experiments with four ASR models trained on four types of audio data (uncompressed .wav format, as well as MP3 formats at three compression bitrates - 128, 64 and 24 kbps). Additionally, when we decoded compressed adversarial examples originating from a different audio format than the training data, in a train-test mismatch scenario, we observed a further alleviation in the error rates. In a parallel series of decoding experiments, we found that MP3 compression applied to speech inputs augmented with \textit{non-adversarial noise} triggers an opposite behaviour of the ASR systems, in which more transcription errors are achieved than for uncompressed noise-augmented inputs. This finding consolidates the previous ones by suggesting that MP3 encoding is effective in diminishing only the adversarial noise. Finally, a statistical test performed on the estimated Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of adversarial inputs confirmed that MP3-compressed adversarial samples had higher SNRs (hence less adversarial noise) than uncompressed adversarial inputs.
